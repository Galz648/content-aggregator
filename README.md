Content Aggregator.

Main concepts:
- aggregate content from multiple sources
- summarize content
- create a feed of content that is relevant to me, and that I can consume in a short amount of time.
- have an interest monitoring system, that would allow me to see what I am interested in, and what I am not interested in, and not consuming. its important to keep your content feed lean, not bloated, flexible, not full of things you dont care about.
resembing the idea of twitter lists built on rss feeds
